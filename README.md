# Summary

This repo contains 3 packages: `@NorthernLights/site`, `@NorthenLights/app` and `@NorthernLights/lib`.

`@NorthernLights/site` -> northernlightstoken.com homepage. In the future, we can add the docs and blog as well.

`@NorthernLights/app` -> dapp.northernlightstoken.com app, a standalone single-page-app. Should be exportable as a static site for deployment on IPFS.

`@NorthernLights/lib` -> A shared component and theme library. For now, just a set of resources shared by the above two apps. In the future, this can be extended and published on NPM as a component library for use in other community projects.
